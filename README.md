jQuery Slidebar
===============

jQuery slidebar solves a perennial problem with the visibility of sidebars on web pages:

If you position a sidebar *statically* in a long page, the user can't see it when they scroll down. You can solve this by *fixing* the sidebar to the page. However, if the sidebar is too long for the user's window, the bottom part will be hidden off-screen.

*Slidebars* solve this problem by dynamically fixing/unfixing themselves to/from the page. When you scroll, the sidebar moves with you *unless* the leading edge is hidden off-screen. If the leading edge is hidden, the slidebar stays in page, allowing you to scroll to the end.

Confused? Don't blame you - it's hard to explain in words. Check out the demo page to see a slidebar in action.
